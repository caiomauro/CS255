**DriverPass Project Summary:**

- **Client:** DriverPass
- **Objective:** Address the issue of subpar driving education, with a focus on lowering the 65% failure rate in driving tests. The project aimed to provide better driver training through online courses and live instruction.

**Strengths:**

Throughout the course, I did a good job in analyzing the systems and visually representing concepts and functions. The diagrams, including classes, activities, sequences, and data flow, brought clarity to the project and gave me a deeper understanding of how applications actually work. 

**Area for Revision:**

If I was going to revise something it would have to be my Gant Chart. While I don't think it was poorly done or incorrect I definelty could have made it better. It was done when I first started using licidchard and understanding all the tools was difficult. I think I would be able to improve its clarity so that it is more readable and conveys the timeline better.

**Interpreting User Needs:**

Considering user needs was foundational to my system design approach. I crafted diagrams reflecting likely user interactions, ensuring the class diagram aligned with sequence and activity diagrams. Prioritizing user needs prevents the system design from remaining too abstract to address practical problems that the developers will face.

**Software Design Approach:**

My approach involves an iterative design method, focusing less on capturing all details initially and allowing for repetitive passes over a project. Each iteration provides deeper insights, incorporating more details than the last. I plan to refine and apply this technique in future projects so that I can make them broad for a start and then work the specifics.
